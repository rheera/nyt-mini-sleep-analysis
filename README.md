# New York Times Mini Crossword Analysis

This is a side project I'm doing to explore trends in crossword completion for the Mini Crossword offered by the [`New York Times (NYT)`](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/game/mini).

### Task 1: Data Collection

Collecting the data was a little tricky since I could only view past scores on the official NYT Games app. I first expanded on [`@alexchandy13`](https://github.com/alexchandy13/nyt-mini-stats/tree/main)'s code. I automated tapping through each day on my iPhone and screen recording it. Then I planned to use OCR, read the data for each frame, and write that to a file. Unfortunately, some of the text wasn't coming out perfectly and I felt I couldn't completely trust the data.

I've now figured out a way to access the data through the API, making it much more trustworthy. Since NYT made it so difficult to collect I don't think they want people to scrape their statistics so I will not upload that part of the code.

## Data Description

New York Times (NYT), a daily newspaper company with perhaps the most renown crossword, creates a daily mini crossword where friends can compete. I've compilied a dataset of all mine and my friends scores from January 1, 2022 till April 30, 2024.

The dataset will be available as a .csv file here.

The below table lists the columns in the data.

      <td>
        What place the user finished for the day. (Eg. 1 being first, 2 meaning 2nd etc.)

## Considerations & Caveats

Since the NYT mini crossword comes out at 10 pm ET there is a chance users completed the next day's puzzle the day before (eg. The April 30th puzzle comes out at 10 pm on April 29th). The NYT's API I used to capture the data didn't have a way for me to gather when a user completed the puzzle. Also, users with an NYT subscription can complete a past puzzle whenever they want so again they could complete a puzzle sometime in the future. Fortunately (or unfortunately ðŸ¤”) most of my friends can't afford the subscription.
